The panel sample is made of EU voters for which we have voting data for
both the 2020 (municipal) and 2024 (EU) elections.

The panel sample is biased against younger voters, which makes sense
since the youngest of them could not yet vote in 2020. It also has more
Portuguese voters and less voters from the largest cities, which is a
likely side effect of its age bias, and slightly less females, which
might again be explained by its age structure.
